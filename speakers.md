[**Bubacarr Bah**](https://sites.google.com/aims.ac.za/bubacarr) Dr Bubacarr Bah is the German Research Chair of Mathematics with specialization in Data Science at AIMS South Africa.
Bubacarr is an applied and computational mathematician and his research interest is at the intersection of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. He worked in the general area of signal and data processing and machine learning. In particular, his work was on the design and analysis of sampling strategies and algorithms for compressed sensing and learning linear embeddings of high-dimensional data sets. Some of his works relates to random matrix theory and numerical linear algebra; while some relates to scientific computing and the use of high performance computing (HPC) resources.

[**Leon Bungert**](https://en.www.math.fau.de/angewandte-mathematik-1/mitarbeiter/leon-bungert/) I am currently a postdoc in applied mathematics at the 
[**Hausdorff Center for Mathematics**](https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de/), Bonn, in the group of [**Franca Hoffmann**](https://francahoffmann.wordpress.com/).
I am interested in applied analysis and numerics, with particular focus on applications in imaging, data science, and machine learning. 
In my [**research**](https://sites.google.com/view/leon-bungert/research?authuser=0) I investigate nonlinear eigenvalue problems, PDEs and variational models (on graphs), and variational regularization of inverse problems and neural networks.

<div class='bioWrapper'>
[**Raphael Hauser**](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/raphael.hauser)  I am a member of the Data Science, 
Numerical Analysis and Mathematical and Computational Finance Groups at the [**Oxford Mathematical Institute**](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/), as well as a Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute.
 My research interest lie in data science, numerical optimisation, 
medical imaging, distributed computing, and in applied probability and statistics.

<div class='bioWrapper'>
[**Peter J Diggle**](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/diggle/) My main methodological research interests are in spatial statistics, longitudinal data analysis and environmental epidemiology. Most of my research is motivated by applications in the biomedical, clinical or health sciences. 
I am particularly interested in real-time health surveillance and in tropical disease epidemiology.
