# Background

The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences Rwanda (AIMS Rwanda) is inviting applications 
for the graduate training school “Foundational Methods in Data Science” scheduled from March 6, 2022 to April 2, 2022 
at AIMS Rwanda in Kigali. Organized around six (6) core courses, and additional training components, 
the highly interactive training school will bring together renowned international and national academics, 
researchers and graduate students, working on topics relevant to modern data science, 
including machine learning and artificial intelligence, their mathematical theories and numerical implementations, 
using methods from statistics, optimization, functional analysis, and control and dynamical systems. 
The training school will provide a platform for researchers and data scientists to interact in an interdisciplinary 
and transdisciplinary environment.
